The algorithms in this paper give fast procedures for computing minimal
nullspace bases. The problem comes naturally after this is the problem
of computing reduced matrix GCDs, or equivalently, the problem of
column reduction, which then leads to the computation of normal forms.
It would be interesting to try applying the ideas from this paper
to these problems.
